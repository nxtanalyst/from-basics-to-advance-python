'''Scenario: OOP-Based Royal Library Management System

This code simulates a Royal Library System where books can be added, borrowed, and returned using object-oriented principles.

Each book (Book) holds individual metadata and availability status.

The Library class centrally manages a catalog of books.

Class methods (add_books, borrow_book, return_book) allow for library-wide operations on the book list.

The static method welcome_note() serves as a general utility message.

The describe() method provides book summaries for users.

This system is perfect for basic inventory and lending management in small educational tools, console-based simulations, or as a prototype for larger GUI-based library systems.'''
